## Scope of project

## Other platforms
We did a literature review and there have been similar platforms developed,
such as [Simply Blood](http://simplyblood.com), [Donor2Donor](http://donor2donor.com/), [Blood4Life.ID](http://blood4life.id/), and [Red Cross Connection](https://www.techinasia.com/singapore-red-cross-gamifies-blood-donations-app).

* [Simply Blood](http://simplyblood.com), developed in 2017  
Simply Blood is an Android and web app developed as a platform to connect blood donors
with blood seekers to alleviate blood shortage, wastage, and transfusion waiting time. After inspecting the app,
we saw that it requires *all* users (donors and seekers) to create
an account with their mobile phone number, which is verified by an SMS OTP. The app also requires blood requesters
to provide their full name, which may be considered a privacy concern, as some users may not want to disclose the 
fact that they have medical conditions which require blood transfusion. **With BloodConnect**, we will design a more intuitive UI which not only looks modern and recent, but also easy to use. BloodConnect will only require *blood seekers*
to register and verify their email address to prevent illegal activities, but allow *blood donors* to use the app
without registration. However, blood donors can create an account to view their donation history, save their
fitness survey for a set period of time (TBC), and be notified of any nearby blood requests. BloodConnect **will not** require users' full name for privacy reasons.

* [Donor2Donor](http://donor2donor.com/), developed in 2016  
This app takes a different approach towards finding blood donations. First of all, this app also allows for organ
donations, not only blood donations. Secondly, this app allows blood seekers to find available blood donors with
maximum radius of 50 km. This approach is different from BloodConnect's, as donors will have to publish their 
availability in the platform and blood seekers will choose from a list of available donors. Donor2Donor, despite having
their website written in English, seems to focus on the Indian community, as their ads are mainly in Hindi. We aim
to enable connections in any parts of the world.

* [Blood4Life.ID](http://blood4life.id/), developed in 2009  
In 2009, Blood4Life.ID used mailing lists, and shifted to Twitter and Facebook in 2010. In 2019, they developed the
[web application](http://blood4life.id) as a more systematic platform. It appears that Blood4Life.ID takes a more
social approach, as their web app contains a lot of posts, events, news, community collaterals, and blood requests
map in between. Also, this platform is only available for the Indonesian community. Its blood donation search
function only "posts" request and donors will have to search and contact the requester directly. **With BloodConnect**,
it will notify nearby users and there is a call-to-action for donors to connect with the requester.

* [Red Cross Connection](https://www.techinasia.com/singapore-red-cross-gamifies-blood-donations-app), developed in 2014  
This platform was developed by the Singapore Red Cross as a campaign, and was officially announced in January 2014.[^1] 
It shared similarities with BloodConnect, however, it is no longer operational. The app allows users to post the 
"number of lives they have saved" and view the "number of blood donations made by their peers".[^2] We believe that 
this feature does not value-add into the problem that the platform was aiming to tackle: 
*amplifying the search for donors*.[^1] Instead, this feature may make blood donation seemed competitive and users can 
showcase the "*number of lives they have saved*". As a reward, blood donors may scan a QR code at donation sites to view an
AR animation an an appreciation for their "selfless and heroic acts".[^3] While we agree with the campaign's message that 
donating blood is a heroic act, the aim of BloodConnect's development is not as a campaign, but as a tool to solve the 
problem with finding blood. That being said, as of now, we do not plan to take a gamified approach towards blood donation.
